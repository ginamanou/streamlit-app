# Welcome to my first dashboard :bar_chart:

An interactive web application in the form of a dashboard created for analyzing and visualizing data acquired from **small punch creep** and **uniaxial creep** laboratory experiments.  

## Introduction

This web app is not intended to be used for actual analysis of real-life experimental data, but rather it was developed as a personal project with main objective the expansion of coding skills. The methods and theory used for the analysis that is presented are mainly based on the European Standard EN 10371:2021, related to the small punch test method, and personal perception and acquisition of knowledge on how SMPA analysis should be performed after the completion of a traineeship in the Structural Materials Performance Assessment (SMPA) Laboratories of JRC Petten. More information regarding the SMPA Laboratories can be found on the following link: [Joint Research Center SMPA Labs](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/structural-materials-performance-assessment-laboratories_en).

## Usage

Since the application is not deployed, it can be launched by cloning the repository locally, installing all the necessary dependencies as described in the requirements.txt file, and running the following line of code from the Terminal:

```
streamlit run stramlit_app_WV01.py
```
