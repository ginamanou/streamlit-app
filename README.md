# Welcome to my first dashboard :bar_chart:

An interactive web application in the form of a dashboard created for analyzing and visualizing data acquired from **small punch creep** and **uniaxial creep** laboratory experiments.  

## Introduction

This web app is not intended to be used for actual analysis of real-life experimental data, but rather it was developed as a personal project with main objective the expansion of coding skills. The methods and theory used for the analysis that is presented are mainly based on the European Standard EN 10371:2021, related to the small punch test method, and personal pesrception and acquisition of knowledge on how SMPA analysis should be performed after the completion of a traineeship in the Structural Materials Performance Assessment (SMPA) Laboratories of JRC Petten. More information regarding the SMPA Laboratories kind be found on the following link: [text](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/structural-materials-performance-assessment-laboratories_en).

## Usage

After the necessary dependencies have been installed as per descrived in the requirements.txt file, the application can be run from the terminal as following:

```
streamlit run <python file with .py extension>
```
